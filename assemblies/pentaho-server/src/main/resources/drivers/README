Big data drivers are not included by default. You are required to download the drivers individually from the
support portal, if desired. The support portal is https://support.pentaho.com/hc/en-us.
After downloading a big data driver, add it to this directory and restart the server.
If you would like the Pentaho server to read the files from a different location,
copy the driver Kar files to the desired location and change the value of the SHIM_DRIVER_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION
property within the kettle.properties file to the full path of the location where the Kar files were placed.
